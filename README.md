# Breast Cancer Diagnostic
This project focuses on classifying cell nuclei characteristics extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The dataset comprises features computed from these images, providing insights into the cellular composition of breast tissue.

## Tools
Utilizing the KNeighborsClassifier algorithm available in scikit-learn, the project aims to classify cell nuclei based on their extracted features. By analyzing attributes such as cell size, shape, and texture, the algorithm can discern patterns indicative of benign or malignant tumors.

## Outcome
Through this project, we aim to develop a predictive model capable of accurately categorizing breast mass cell nuclei, aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Leveraging machine learning techniques and image analysis, we strive to contribute to advancements in medical diagnostics and patient care.
